        <p>
          Wongani Jere is an aspiring Software Developer living in North Carolina studying and perfecting his skills as a Full Stack Developer. 
          <br>
          Having a background in Music Production, Photography, and Filmmaking—he hopes to sharpen his skills within the browser to create websites and applications that can further the crafts of many likeminded artists in the industry. Wongani hopes to learn the fundamental tools he needs to be able to turn as many concepts as possible into a working model to push the scope of what's imaginable on the internet. 
<br>
          To the right is Wongani’s current body of deployable work hosted on Github showcasing his coding abilities. And two the left are the best ways to get in contact with Wongani. Email is the preferred method, but feel free to reach out on whatever platform you find most convenient.
